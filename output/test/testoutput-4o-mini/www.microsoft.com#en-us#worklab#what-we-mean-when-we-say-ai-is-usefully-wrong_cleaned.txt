## The Nature of AI Suggestions

When you brainstorm with a person, their throwing-spaghetti-at-the-wall suggestions aren’t usually The Thing. They’re ideas—points of view that may fit together or may not. They stimulate your creative juices, helping you get to The Thing. The same is true of AI: Ask Copilot for 20 suggestions for a catchy presentation title, and bam! You receive a list of relevant ideas in seconds. They won’t all be the perfect title you’re looking for, but often one or two will spark real inspiration—leading you toward a title you’d never come up with on your own.

At Microsoft, we like to say that this is when AI is “usefully wrong.” It encourages a different, more collaborative way of working with technology—one that challenges our long-held assumptions about what computers can and can’t do. We’re used to one interaction with a computer: put in a query, get an answer. With AI, the answer isn’t the final word; the magic lies in the conversation and the back-and-forth. It’s up to people to build on, combine, or transform the content into something original and meaningful.

## Divergent Thinking with AI

Wharton professor and AI expert Ethan Mollick refers to generative AI as “alien intelligence.” Because it synthesizes ideas and information in novel ways, it can often propose unconventional ideas. To harness this divergent thinking, you need to be open-minded and curious. AI can present content that is unexpected, surprising, or just plain weird. Don’t let that discourage you; instead, embrace the challenge to approach a problem from a different perspective.

## Using AI Effectively

It’s crucial to check that any AI-generated content is complete and correct. AI isn’t a replacement for your creativity or judgment; it’s a tool that can enhance and augment those innately human skills. Don’t blindly accept or follow AI suggestions; evaluate them carefully and objectively. Ask yourself: Is this content relevant and appropriate? How can I improve or refine it? How can I add my own voice or style to it?

AI’s suggestions are a puzzle that’s nearly finished—it just needs your expertise to be complete.
